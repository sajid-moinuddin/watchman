Night gathers, and now my watch begins.

---
my learning python via doing something useful project. 

Plan is to scrape newrelic and various other datasource from my raspberry pi and use text2speech commands to draw attention. Also utilize my anki-vektor to make some noise and display summary on the pi screen. 

Done right, it can become a 50$ 24/7 low powered custom personal monitoring tool. 

NOTE: the project use pybuilder, pls follow pybuilder docs how to setup/run

TODO: 
- hookup vector handler
- hookup commandline argument parser to run with/without vector etc
- setup logging etc more nicely rather than jamming into main
